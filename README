-=-=-= What/Why? =-=-=-
Created this for P vs NP

Can sort millions of numbers in seconds

Have a lot of names I thought of:
p-sort, exlin, linex, ex-sort, mem-sort

-=-=-= How? =-=-=-
Uses memory trade off to skip checking values
e.g.
Places 1 at 1 and 2 at 2 - 1 < 2 will always be true

1. Allocate memory for sort[] (input)
2. Create input (RNG, list, count 0-size)
3. Find high and low values in sort[]
4. Size and allocate goal[] (range to sort output - also dupes[] for duplicate numbers)
5. Place sort[cnt] to goal[ sort[cnt] - lo], increase dupes[]
6. Loop through dupes[] and place goal[] to sort[]
7. Print output and free() memory

-=-=-= Limitations =-=-=-
Memory

Uses high and low values to make an array
This is easy to segfault
A large difference in numbers has a big impact

e.g.
A million 1's will use less memory than 1 and 1 billion
e.g.
Giving a list with 0 and 9trillion (high range 64bit number)
will cause it to try to use more memory than possible

Obviously, a small list of numbers far apart is a waste of memory
